    We know that the internet is a wonderful place to visit but why do some thing on a webpage catch our eye more than others. It is because of the
    <i>formatting </i> and the
    <b> emphasis </b> of different elements to a page.
    <b>Bold</b>
    <i>italic</i>
    <u>underline</u> <i>em</i> and <b>strong</b> are all tags that can be used for this task. </body>
